# Portfolio

Daniel Miller

Hi, I'm Daniel! I'm a technical writer who focuses on clarity, structure, and helping users understand complex products without friction. I’ve created documentation, blog content, and developer-facing guides for teams at IBM, Varonis, and other organizations.

## About This Portfolio

This repo collects writing samples, small projects, and experiments. It’s a place to show how I think about content, organization, and user needs.

- Clear, accessible content for both [technical](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-storage-odf-local&interface=ui) and [non-technical readers](https://www.varonis.com/blog/dspm-and-kubernetes)
